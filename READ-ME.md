# README Generator

## Description
README Generator is a command-line application designed to help with the creation of professional README.md files for GitHub projects. By using this tool, developers can quickly generate README files with essential sections like Description, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. The generator prompts users for details about their project, including the title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and license choice and then it creates a README.md file from that with links to the developerâ€™s GitHub profile and email address at the end. To use the generator, simply install Node.js and npm, then run the application using the prompt `node index.js`, follow the interactive prompts, and the README file will be generated.
